# Building_Custom_loss_functions
This repo will contain detailed and more visualized tutorials(loss and results) on writing custom loss functions. Scope will be ranging from basic neural networks to RL. it will also explain about existing loss function with SOTA results.


Following will be covered:

Classification-
- Normal CNN layers networks
- Resnet, Densenet

Detection
- Yolo
- SSD, Mobilenet

Tracking 
- Deepsort+Yolo

Others
- 4 GAN Models
- 1 R-CNN model

RL - Single Agent
- DQN Model
- DDPG model
- TD3 model

RL - Multi Agent
- DQN Model
- DDPG model
- TD3 model


Completion of this would take a person from Beginer level DL programmer to intermediate level DL and RL programmer
